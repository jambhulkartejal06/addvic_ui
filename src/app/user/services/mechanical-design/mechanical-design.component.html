                 As such a variety of diverse activities are involved in product design. It includes defining the perspective of problem users and generating a solution. It also covers all aspects of the new product, however, such as the methods used to manufacture it its style, the materials used, its mechanical architecture, and more. Very simply, it's about making a product that works. To bring any equipment into reality, there should be a rough digital draft prepared to study and analyse looks and functions. Through CAD design we provide all these service ranging from creation, modification and optimization. 3D modelling enables realistic models or parts and assemblies to be designed by engineers and designers. Such models can then be 3D printed or CNC machined and used to perform complex simulations. We understand your ideas and after studying the plausibility we help them convert from 2D to 3D model. Our software eases the process of digital designing, visualising and stimulating most complex ideas. It removes manual drafting and makes whole process automated to increase the efficiency and save time. In drafting, we provide technological solutions for design and technical documentation in manufacturing and assembly field. Our software enables both design engineers and skilled drafters with detailed geometry to produce error-free product manufacturing drawings. Assembly drafting ensures seamless communication channel between design engineers and shop floor workers on how the actual product will look based on its drafting design. We understand our client and based on 2D design of required product, we provide them dimensions for 3D environment and other details as like symbols, rotational specifics and other details. Through 3D rendering, we design a graphically perceivable object from complex data so that our client has better understanding of product design including minor details like lighting and shadows. With attaching materials, placing user-defined lights, and adding a backdrop, a rendered image can be created for a new model. In mechanical product designs, there are many parts which require repetitive designing and therefore parametric modelling can help to automate the process without changing design features, constraints and measurements. For families of product that require slight variation from core design, we use parametric modelling for better accuracy as designs are changed but the core structure remains same. Apart from all the designs mentioned above, we are also proficient in developing a new design from an existing one. Opening up an existing design, changing certain features and creating something new is simple, and a designer no longer needs to start from scratch. This means that producing personalised designs that fulfil the needs or expectations of a client or consumer is simpler and faster than ever before.

                Engineering analysis involves applying the concepts and processes of scientific analytics to expose the properties and condition of a system, device or mechanism under study. In this field we provide services in Finite element analysis (FEA) where it shows simulation of any physical phenomenon. In mechanical engineering, there are various phenomenon which require analysis before the real product is manufactured, so through FEA we have basic idea of product and therefore It reduces number of physical prototype required and run virtual drafts to optimize the design. Among various numerical solution techniques, we provide Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which is the study of fluid flows. Through that you can analyse complex issues involving fluid-fluid, fluid-solid or fluid-gas interaction. CFD is advantageous since a small number of quantities are calculated at a time in real life experiments, while all desired quantities can be measured at once and with a high resolution in space and time in a CFD analysis. Through multibody dynamics, we help our clients study dynamic behaviour of interconnected rigid and flexible bodies which undergo motion and that can be calculated using different conditions. MBD simulations are also combined with other advanced analyses, such as an extended integrity analysis conducted through Finite Element Analyses of a single part or a whole assembly.

                    This is an important step in manufacturing a real product. When the design of the product is finalised based on the requirements, one can get its physical prototype to get to know how the product will turn out to be. Through 3D printing, a product prototype can be converted to a real product. It allows you to enhance the process of product creation, enabling you to create lower-cost high-quality prototypes. In order to build your designs, 3D printing is the ideal solution. You can get access to a wide variety of useful 3D printing materials by starting to create your project using 3D printing, saving time and money. 3D printing is transforming the manufacturing sector all over the world rapidly. Not only is making designs more affordable than ever, but there is also a higher degree of versatility that we have not seen before. This model of construction materials is beginning to gain more popularity, and in the near future it is predicted to be the new standard. For manufacturing industry particularly, 3D printing has cut much middle costs and we aim to do the same for our clients using our software and match your requirements of the product.

                    For research and development, we are not restricted to any specific field. We have our expertise in mechanical, education and information technology sectors. We use our experience and use it for concept design and development in those sectors. We try to understand the basic requirements of our clients and based on that we apply Research and development strategies to find a solution for them. R&D takes place at technology laboratories in a concentrated way, where engineers define the technology, techniques and methodologies that are most suitable for solving particular customer challenges. Basic research is aimed at understanding the fundamental aspects of a concept or phenomenon in a fuller, more complete way. In R&D, this understanding is typically the first step. These activities provide a context for information on goods, practises, or operating processes without being guided to applications. To address generic market issues, our R&D team also designs re-usable frameworks and components. R&D is separate from the majority of operational activities carried out by a company. Typically, research and/or development is not done with the expectation of immediate profit. Instead it is anticipated to contribute to a company's long-term profitability and we take it as a long term goal. As discoveries are made and products developed, R&D can lead to patents, copyrights, and trademarks. It is seen that most of companies spent huge sum of money for their R&D- we provide our clients with research reports and analysis while in industry budget.

                    Tooling design is an important part of the manufacturing process of any product. In order to ensure production success, the design team needs to consider manufacturing design principles in consultation with the die cut tooling provider. In tool designing, our team carefully assess blueprint and stream out potential design flaws before commencing work. Jigs and fixtures are production instruments that are used to produce components that are interchangeable and identical. They are unique tool-guiding and work-holding devices designed specifically for the large number of parts being machined and assembled. Designing them helps to eliminate need for setup for every work piece thereby facilitating efficient production and increase durability. In manufacturing operations, the application of jigs and fixtures leads to the production of goods that are quicker, more precise and durable at a reduced cost. In pattern and die designing, we support simulation-based testing of Dies before production, Customized Die Design Manufacturing, Shop-floor Die try-outs to prove the working. We understand your die and pattern requirement and based on that we design the products. Further press tool is a metal forming tool designed to cut metal by applying force. We expertise in providing press tool designs with custom designs to cut, punch, sheer and bend materials.

                    In concept design, we understand different requirements of customers and design concept based on their requirements. Concept design shows us what problems that product will solve, how it will solve them, and what would be the end result of the whole process. In general, concept design takes place after feasibility studies and evaluations of alternatives have been completed and a project brief has been prepared. The purpose of concept design is to recognise current problems in basic research and to provide guidance for the pilot tests and simulation tests that follow. The concept design reflects the initial response of the design team to the project brief. Different aspects of the product, such as user interface, usability, styling, technology, are considered at this point. Without going too far into depth. We work out a number of the most promising ideas into product concepts when the solution space is adequately explored and several ideas have been created. There should not be any significant residual ambiguity in such a conception. That forces us to make it concrete and look at all the characteristics and implications of the product definition. This phase results in clean product streamlining path and mitigating all the risks for the end product.
